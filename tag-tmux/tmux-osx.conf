# Attach the shell to the user namespace

# This allows us to launch a process and have that process be attached to the
# per-user bootstrap namespace, which, to put it simply, makes the program
# behave as we are expecting.
#
# The “trick” is to configure tmux to launch its shells with the
# reattach-to-user-namespace wrapper. By doing that, the shells tmux launches,
# as well as everything those shells launch, will be attached to the user
# namespace
